  abstract =     {As carbon ions, at therapeutic energies, penetrate
                  tissue, they undergo inelastic nuclear reactions and
                  give rise to significant yields of secondary
                  fragment fluences. Therefore, an accurate prediction
                  of these fluences resulting from the primary carbon
                  interactions is necessary in the patient's body in
                  order to precisely simulate the spatial dose
                  distribution and the resulting biological effect. In
                  this paper, the performance of nuclear fragmentation
                  models of the Monte Carlo transport codes, FLUKA and
                  GEANT4, in tissue-like media and for an energy
                  regime relevant for therapeutic carbon ions is
                  investigated. The ability of these Monte Carlo codes
                  to reproduce experimental data of charge-changing
                  cross sections and integral and differential yields
                  of secondary charged fragments is evaluated. For the
                  fragment yields, the main focus is on the
                  consideration of experimental approximations and
                  uncertainties such as the energy measurement by
                  time-of-flight. For GEANT4, the hadronic models
                  G4BinaryLightIonReaction and G4QMD are benchmarked
                  together with some recently enhanced de-excitation
                  models. For non-differential quantities,
                  discrepancies of some tens of percent are found for
                  both codes. For differential quantities, even larger
                  deviations are found. Implications of these findings
                  for the therapeutic use of carbon ions are
                  discussed.},

  abstract =     {(16)O and (12)C ion beams will be used-besides
                  lighter ions-for cancer treatment at the Heidelberg
                  Ion Therapy Center (HIT), Germany. It is planned to
                  monitor the treatment by means of in-beam positron
                  emission tomography (PET) as it is done for therapy
                  with (12)C beams at the experimental facility at the
                  Gesellschaft f\"{u}r Schwerionenforschung (GSI),
                  Darmstadt, Germany. To enable PET also for (16)O
                  beams, experimental data of the beta(+)-activity
                  created by these beams are needed. Therefore,
                  in-beam PET measurements of the activity created by
                  (16)O beams of various energies on targets of PMMA,
                  water and graphite were performed at GSI for the
                  first time. Additionally reference measurements of
                  (12)C beams on the same target materials were
                  done. The results of the measurements are
                  presented. The deduction of clinically relevant
                  results from in-beam PET data requires reliable
                  simulations of the beta(+)-activity production,
                  which is done presently by a dedicated code limited
                  to (12)C beams. Because this code is not extendable
                  to other ions in an easy way, a new code, capable of
                  simulating the production of the beta(+)-activity by
                  all ions of interest, is needed. Our choice is the
                  general purpose Monte Carlo code FLUKA which was
                  used to simulate the ion transport, the
                  beta(+)-active isotope production, the decay, the
                  positron annihilation and the transport of the
                  annihilation photons. The detector response was
                  simulated with an established software that gives
                  the output in the same list-mode data format as in
                  the experiment. This allows us to use the same
                  software to reconstruct measured and simulated data,
                  which makes comparisons easier and more
                  reliable. The calculated activity distribution shows
                  general good agreement with the measurements.},

                  developed using the Geant4 toolkit. The Monte Carlo
                  model was used to produce depth dose and lateral
                  profiles, which were compared to data measured in
                  the clinical scanning treatment nozzle at several
                  energies. Comparisons were also made between
                  measured and simulated off-axis profiles to test the
                  accuracy of the model's magnetic
                  steering. Comparison of the 80\% distal dose
                  fall-off values for the measured and simulated depth
                  dose profiles agreed to within 1 mm for the beam
                  energies evaluated. Agreement of the full width at
                  half maximum values for the measured and simulated
                  lateral fluence profiles was within 1.3 mm for all

                  emitted from tissue equivalent phantoms during

  abstract =     {One of the long-standing problems in carbon-ion
                  therapy is the monitoring of the treatment, i.e. of
                  the delivered dose to a given tissue volume within
                  the patient. Over the last 8 years, in-beam positron
                  emission tomography (PET) has been used at the
                  experimental carbon ion treatment facility at the
                  Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI)
                  Darmstadt and has become a valuable quality
                  assurance tool. In order to determine and evaluate
                  the correct delivery of the patient dose, a
                  simulation of the positron emitter distribution has
                  been compared to the measurement. One particular
                  effect is the blurring as well as the reduction of
                  the measured activity distribution via washout. The
                  objective of this study is the investigation of
                  tissue dependent effective half-lives from patient
                  data. We find no significant dependence of the
                  effective half-life on the Hounsfield unit but on
                  the local dose. The biological half-life within the
                  high dose region is longer than in the low dose
                  region. Furthermore, the influence of the overall
                  treatment time on the kinetics of the positron
                  emitter is reported. There are indications for a
                  metabolic response of the tissue on the
                  irradiation. Taking into account the biological
                  half-life in the simulation leads to an improvement
                  of the quality of the PET-images in some cases.},

@Article{Parodi2008,
  abstract =     {PURPOSE: The benefit of using dedicated in-beam
                  positron emission tomography (PET) detectors in the
                  treatment room instead of commercial tomographs
                  nearby is an open question. This work quantitatively
                  compares the measurable signal for in-beam and
                  offline PET imaging, taking into account realistic
                  acquisition strategies at different ion beam
                  facilities. Both scenarios of pulsed and continuous
                  irradiation from synchrotron and cyclotron
                  accelerators are considered, because of their
                  widespread use in most carbon ion and proton therapy
                  centers. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A mathematical
                  framework is introduced to compare the
                  time-dependent amount and spatial distribution of
                  decays from irradiation-induced isotope
                  production. The latter is calculated with Monte
                  Carlo techniques for real proton treatments of
                  head-and-neck and paraspinal tumors. Extrapolation
                  to carbon ion irradiation is based on results of
                  previous phantom experiments. Biologic clearance is
                  modeled taking into account available data from
                  previous animal and clinical studies. RESULTS:
                  Ratios between the amount of physical decays
                  available for in-beam and offline detection range
                  from 40\% to 60\% for cyclotron-based facilities, to
                  65\% to 110\% (carbon ions) and 94\% to 166\%
                  (protons) at synchrotron-based facilities, and
                  increase when including biologic clearance. Spatial
                  distributions of decays during irradiation exhibit
                  better correlation with the dose delivery and
                  reduced influence of biologic
                  processes. CONCLUSIONS: In-beam imaging can be
                  advantageous for synchrotron-based facilities,
                  provided that efficient PET systems enabling
                  detection of isotope decays during beam extraction
                  are implemented. For very short (<2 min) irradiation
                  times at cyclotron-based facilities, a few minutes
                  of acquisition time after the end of irradiation are
                  needed for counting statistics, thus affecting
                  patient throughput.},

  abstract =     {Clinical investigations on post-irradiation PET/CT
                  (positron emission tomography/computed tomography)
                  imaging for in vivo verification of treatment
                  delivery and, in particular, beam range in proton
                  therapy are underway at Massachusetts General
                  Hospital (MGH). Within this project, we have
                  developed a Monte Carlo framework for CT-based
                  calculation of dose and irradiation-induced positron
                  emitter distributions. Initial proton beam
                  information is provided by a separate Geant4 Monte
                  Carlo simulation modelling the treatment
                  head. PArticle transport in the patient is performed
                  in the CT voxel geometry using the FLUKA Monte Carlo
                  code. The implementation uses a discrete number of
                  different tissue types with composition and mean
                  density deduced from the CT scan. Scaling factors
                  are introduced to account for the continuous
                  Hounsfield unit dependence of the mass density and
                  of the relative stopping power ratio to water used
                  by the treatment planning system (XiO (Computerized
                  Medical Systems Inc.)). Resulting Monte Carlo dose
                  distributions are generally found in good
                  correspondence with calculations of the treatment
                  planning program, except a few cases (e.g. in the
                  presence of air/tissue interfaces). Whereas dose is
                  computed using standard FLUKA utilities, positron
                  emitter distributions are calculated by internally
                  combining proton fluence with experimental and
                  evaluated cross-sections yielding 11C, 15O, 14O,
                  13N, 38K and 30P. Simulated positron emitter
                  distributions yield PET images in good agreement
                  with measurements. In this paper, we describe in
                  detail the specific implementation of the FLUKA
                  calculation framework, which may be easily adapted
                  to handle arbitrary phase spaces of proton beams
                  delivered by other facilities or include more
                  reaction channels based on additional cross-section
                  data. Further, we demonstrate the effects of
                  different acquisition time regimes (e.g., PET
                  imaging during or after irradiation) on the
                  intensity and spatial distribution of the
                  irradiation-induced beta+-activity signal for the

                  obtained during and after irradiation, where
                  available. Positron-emitting nuclei are created by a
                  (12)C beam in fragmentation reactions of projectile
                  and target nuclei. This leads to a beta(+)-activity
                  profile characterized by a noticeable peak located
                  close to the Bragg peak in the corresponding
                  depth-dose distribution. This can be used for dose
                  monitoring in carbon-ion therapy of cancer. In
                  contrast, as most of the positron-emitting nuclei
                  are produced by a (3)He beam in target fragmentation
                  reactions, the calculated total beta(+)-activity
                  during or soon after the irradiation period is
                  evenly distributed within the projectile
                  range. However, we predict also the presence of
                  (13)N, (14)O, (17,18)F created in charge-transfer
                  reactions by low-energy (3)He ions close to the end
                  of their range in several tissue-like media. The
                  time evolution of beta(+)-activity profiles was
                  investigated for both kinds of beams. We found that
                  due to the production of (18)F nuclides the
                  beta(+)-activity profile measured 2 or 3 h after
                  irradiation with (3)He ions will have a distinct
                  peak correlated with the maximum of depth-dose
                  distribution. We also found certain advantages of
                  low-energy (3)He beams over low-energy proton beams
                  for reliable PET monitoring during pArticle therapy
                  of shallow-located tumours. In this case the distal
                  edge of beta(+)-activity distribution from (17)F
                  nuclei clearly marks the range of (3)He in tissues.},

  abstract =     {PURPOSE: To investigate methods of reporting and
                  analyzing statistical uncertainties in doses to
                  targets and normal tissues in Monte Carlo (MC)-based
                  treatment planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Methods
                  for quantifying statistical uncertainties in dose,
                  such as uncertainty speciﬁcation to speciﬁc dose
                  points, or to volume-based regions, were analyzed in
                  MC-based treatment planning for 5 lung cancer
                  patients. The eﬀect of statistical uncertainties on
                  target and normal tissue dose indices was
                  evaluated. The concept of uncertainty volume
                  histograms for targets and organs at risk was
                  examined, along with its utility, in conjunction
                  with dose volume histograms, in assessing the
                  acceptability of the statistical precision in dose
                  distributions. The uncertainty evaluation tools were
                  extended to four-dimensional planning for
                  application on multiple instances of the patient
                  geometry. All calculations were performed using the
                  Dose Planning Method MC code. RESULTS: For targets,
                  generalized equivalent uniform doses and mean target
                  doses converged at 150 million simulated histories,
                  corresponding to relative uncertainties of less than
                  2\% in the mean target doses. For the normal lung
                  tissue (a volume-eﬀect organ), mean lung dose and
                  normal tissue complication probability converged at
                  150 million histories despite the large range in the
                  relative organ uncertainty volume histograms. For
                  "serial" normal tissues such as the spinal cord,
                  large ﬂuctuations exist in point dose relative
                  uncertainties. CONCLUSIONS: The tools presented here
                  provide useful means for evaluating statistical
                  precision in MC-based dose distributions. Tradeoﬀs
                  between uncertainties in doses to targets,
                  volume-eﬀect organs, and "serial" normal tissues
                  must be considered carefully in determining
                  acceptable levels of statistical precision in
                  MC-computed dose distributions.},

                  is currently the only method for an in situ
                  monitoring of highly tumour-conformed charged hadron
                  therapy. At the experimental carbon ion tumour
                  therapy facility, running at the Gesellschaft
                  f\"{u}r Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany,
                  all treatments have been monitored by means of a
                  specially adapted dual-head PET scanner. The
                  positive clinical impact of this project triggered
                  the construction of a hospital-based hadron therapy
                  facility, with in-beam PET expected to monitor more
                  delicate radiotherapeutic situations. Therefore, we
                  have studied possible in-beam PET improvements by
                  optimizing the arrangement of the gamma-ray
                  detectors. For this, a fully 3D, rebinning-free,
                  maximum likelihood expectation maximization
                  algorithm applicable to several closed-ring or
                  dual-head tomographs has been developed. The
                  analysis of beta(+)-activity distributions simulated
                  from real-treatment situations and detected with
                  several detector arrangements allows us to conclude
                  that a dual-head tomograph with narrow gaps yields
                  in-beam PET images with sufficient quality for
                  monitoring head and neck treatments. For monitoring
                  larger irradiation fields, e.g. treatments in the
                  pelvis region, a closed-ring tomograph was seen to
                  be highly desirable. Finally, a study of the space
                  availability for patient and bed, tomograph and beam
                  portal proves the implementation of a closed-ring
                  detector arrangement for in-beam PET to be
                  feasible.},

  abstract =     {In-beam positron emission tomography (PET) is
                  currently used for monitoring the dose delivery at
                  the heavy ion therapy facility at GSI Darmstadt. The
                  method is based on the fact that carbon ions produce
                  positron emitting isotopes in fragmentation
                  reactions with the atomic nuclei of the tissue. The
                  relation between dose and beta(+)-activity is not
                  straightforward. Hence it is not possible to infer
                  the delivered dose directly from the PET
                  distribution. To overcome this problem and enable
                  therapy monitoring, beta(+)-distributions are
                  simulated on the basis of the treatment plan and
                  compared with the measured ones. Following the
                  positive clinical impact, it is planned to apply the
                  method at future ion therapy facilities, where beams
                  from protons up to oxygen nuclei will be
                  available. A simulation code capable of handling all
                  these ions and predicting the irradiation-induced
                  beta(+)-activity distributions is desirable. An
                  established and general purpose radiation transport
                  code is preferred. FLUKA is a candidate for such a
                  code. For application to in-beam PET therapy
                  monitoring, the code has to model with high accuracy
                  both the electromagnetic and nuclear interactions
                  responsible for dose deposition and beta(+)-activity
                  production, respectively. In this work, the
                  electromagnetic interaction in FLUKA was adjusted to
                  reproduce the same pArticle range as from the
                  experimentally validated treatment planning software
                  TRiP, used at GSI. Furthermore, projectile
                  fragmentation spectra in water targets have been
                  studied in comparison to available experimental
                  data. Finally, cross sections for the production of
                  the most abundant fragments have been calculated and
                  compared to values found in the literature.},

                  (PET) image obtained after proton irradiation and
                  investigate the usefulness of the image for
                  confirmation of the irradiated volume in proton
                  radiotherapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A
                  homogenous phantom was irradiated separately by
                  carbon-ion and proton beams and the images obtained
                  were compared. The PET images of cancer patients
                  just after proton RT were then taken after informed
                  consent. RESULTS: In the PET image produced by
                  carbon-ion beams, the high pixel counts in the image
                  corresponded to the Bragg peak; however, in that
                  produced by proton beams, they were visible
                  throughout the entire track of the proton beams and
                  were not related to the Bragg peak. The PET image of
                  patients treated with proton RT was similar to that
                  of the phantom experiment. CONCLUSION: The PET image
                  after proton RT was different from that of
                  carbon-ion RT. It was found that the PET image was
                  very useful in proton RT to verify treatment

                  deep-seated tumours were delivered by the
                  synchrotron of the Gesellschaft f\"{u}r
                  Schwerionenforschung Darmstadt (GSI). They were
                  stopped in PMMA blocks placed in the centre of the
                  field of view of the positron camera that is
                  installed in the heavy ion tumour treatment facility
                  at GSI. The beta+ activity signal was found to be
                  three times larger than that produced by carbon ions
                  at the same range and applied physical dose. The
                  reconstructed spatial beta+ activity distributions
                  were analysed and compared with the production of
                  positron emitters predicted by a calculation based
                  on experimental cross-sections and on the proton
                  flux given by the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. The shape
                  of the depth-activity profiles was well reproduced
                  by the model and the correlation with the proton
                  range and the depth-dose distributions was carefully

  abstract =     {The clinical implementation and application of a
                  novel treatment planning system (TPS) for scanned
                  ion beams is described, which is in clinical use for
                  carbon ion treatments at the German heavy ion
                  facility (GSI). All treatment plans are evaluated on
                  the basis of biologically eﬀective dose
                  distributions. For therapy control, in-beam positron
                  emission tomography (PET) and an online monitoring
                  system for the beam intensity and position are
                  used. The absence of a gantry restricts the
                  treatment plans to horizontal beams. Most of the
                  treatment plans consist of two nearly opposing
                  lateral ﬁelds or sometimes orthogonal ﬁelds. In only
                  a very few cases a single beam was used. For
                  patients with very complex target volumes lateral
                  and even distal ﬁeld patching techniques were
                  applied. Additional improvements can be achieved
                  when the patient's head is ﬁxed in a tilted
                  position, in order to achieve sparing of the organs
                  at risk. In order to test the stability of dose
                  distributions in the case of patient misalignments
                  we routinely simulate the eﬀects of misalignments
                  for patients with critical structures next to the
                  target volume. The uncertainties in the range
                  calculation are taken into account by a margin
                  around the target volume of typically 2-3 mm, which
                  can, however, be extended if the simulation
                  demonstrates larger deviations. The novel TPS
                  developed for scanned ion beams was introduced into
                  clinical routine in December 1997 and was used for
                  the treatment planning of 63 patients with head and
                  neck tumours until July 2000. Planning strategies
                  and methods were developed for this tumour location
                  that facilitate the treatment of a larger number of
                  patients with the scanned heavy ion beam in a
                  clinical setting. Further developments aim towards a
                  simultaneous optimization of the treatment ﬁeld
                  intensities and more eﬀective procedures for the
                  patient set-up. The results demonstrate that ion
                  beams can be integrated into a clinical environment
                  for treatment planning and delivery.},

                  for heavy-ion radiotherapy based on the local effect
                  model (LEM) which allows us to calculate the
                  biologically effective dose not only for the target
                  region but also for the entire irradiation
                  volume. LEM is ideally suited for use as an integral
                  part of treatment planning code systems for active
                  dose shaping devices like the GSI raster scan
                  system. Thus it has been incorporated into our
                  standard treatment planning system for ion therapy
                  (TRiP). Single intensity modulated fields can be
                  optimized with respect to a homogeneous biologically

  abstract =     {The characteristic Bragg peak of protons or heavy
                  ions provides a good localization of dose in three
                  dimensions. Through their ability to deliver
                  laterally and distally shaped homogenous fields,
                  protons have been shown to be a precise and
                  practical method for delivering highly conformal
                  radiotherapy. However, in an analogous manner to
                  intensity modulation for photons, protons can be
                  used to construct dose distributions through the
                  application of many individually inhomogeneous
                  fields, but with the localization of dose in the
                  Bragg peak providing the possibility of modulating
                  intensity within each field in two or three
                  dimensions. We describe four different methods of
                  intensity modulation for protons and describe how
                  these have been implemented in an existing proton
                  planning system. As a preliminary evaluation of the
                  efficacy of these methods, each has been applied to
                  an example case using a variety of field
                  combinations. Dose-volume histogram analysis of the
                  resulting dose distributions shows that when large
                  numbers of fields are used, all techniques exhibit
                  both good target homogeneity and sparing of
                  neighbouring critical structures, with little
                  difference between the four techniques being
                  discerned. As the number of fields is decreased,
                  however, only a full 3D modulation of individual
                  Bragg peaks can preserve both target coverage and
                  sparing of normal tissues. We conclude that the 3D
                  method provides the greatest flexibility for
                  constructing conformal doses in challenging
                  situations, but that when large numbers of beam
                  ports are available, little advantage may be gained
                  from the additional modulation of intensity in
                  depth.},

  abstract =     {GATE (Geant4 Application for Emission Tomography) is
                  a Monte Carlo simulation platform developed by the
                  OpenGATE collaboration since 2001 and first publicly
                  released in 2004. Dedicated to the modelling of
                  planar scintigraphy, single photon emission computed
                  tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography
                  (PET) acquisitions, this platform is widely used to
                  assist PET and SPECT research. A recent extension of
                  this platform, released by the OpenGATE
                  collaboration as GATE V6, now also enables modelling
                  of x-ray computed tomography and radiation therapy
                  experiments. This paper presents an overview of the
                  main additions and improvements implemented in GATE
                  since the publication of the initial GATE paper (Jan
                  et al 2004 Phys. Med. Biol. 49 4543-61). This
                  includes new models available in GATE to simulate
                  optical and hadronic processes, novelties in
                  modelling tracer, organ or detector motion, new
                  options for speeding up GATE simulations, examples
                  illustrating the use of GATE V6 in radiotherapy
                  applications and CT simulations, and preliminary
                  results regarding the validation of GATE V6 for
                  radiation therapy applications. Upon completion of
                  extensive validation studies, GATE is expected to
                  become a valuable tool for simulations involving
                  both radiotherapy and imaging.},

  abstract =     {The purpose of this work was to compare the clinical
                  adaptation of prompt gamma (PG) imaging and positron
                  emission tomography (PET) as independent tools for
                  non-invasive proton beam range verification and
                  treatment validation. The PG range correlation and
                  its differences with PET have been modeled for the
                  first time in a highly heterogeneous tissue
                  environment, using different field sizes and
                  configurations. Four patients with different tumor
                  locations (head and neck, prostate, spine and
                  abdomen) were chosen to compare the site-specific
                  behaviors of the PG and PET images, using both
                  passive scattered and pencil beam fields. Accurate
                  reconstruction of dose, PG and PET distributions was
                  achieved by using the planning computed tomography
                  (CT) image in a validated GEANT4-based Monte Carlo
                  code capable of modeling the treatment nozzle and
                  patient anatomy in detail. The physical and
                  biological washout phenomenon and decay half-lives
                  for PET activity for the most abundant isotopes such
                  as (11)C, (15)O, (13)N, (30)P and (38)K were taken
                  into account in the data analysis. The attenuation
                  of the gamma signal after traversing the patient
                  geometry and respective detection efficiencies were
                  estimated for both methods to ensure proper
                  comparison. The projected dose, PG and PET profiles
                  along many lines in the beam direction were analyzed
                  to investigate the correlation consistency across
                  the beam width. For all subjects, the PG method
                  showed on average approximately 10 times higher
                  gamma production rates than the PET method before,
                  and 60 to 80 times higher production after including
                  the washout correction and acquisition time
                  delay. This rate strongly depended on tissue density
                  and elemental composition. For broad passive
                  scattered fields, it was demonstrated that large
                  differences exist between PG and PET signal falloff
                  positions and the correlation with the dose
                  distribution for different lines in the beam
                  direction. These variations also depended on the
                  treatment site and the particular subject. Thus,
                  similar to PET, direct range verification with PG in
                  passive scattering is not easily viable. However,
                  upon development of an optimized 3D PG detector,
                  indirect range verification by comparing measured
                  and simulated PG distributions (currently being
                  explored for the PET method) would be more
                  beneficial because it can avoid the inherent
                  biological challenges of the PET imaging. The
                  improved correlation of PG and PET with dose when
                  using pencil beams was evident. PG imaging was found
                  to be potentially advantageous especially for small
                  tumors in the presence of high tissue
                  heterogeneities. Including the effects of detector
                  acceptance and efficiency may hold PET superior in
                  terms of the amplitude of the detected signal
                  (depending on the future development of PG detection
                  technology), but the ability to perform online
                  measurements and avoid signal disintegration (due to
                  washout) with PG are important factors that can
                  outweigh the benefits of higher detection
                  sensitivity.},

@article{Grevillot2011,
  abstract =     {The GEANT4-based GATE Monte Carlo (MC) platform was
                  initially focused on PET and SPECT simulations. The
                  new release v6.0 (February 2010) proposes new tools
                  dedicated for radiation therapy simulations. In this
                  work, we investigated some part of this extension
                  and proposed a general methodology for Linac
                  simulations. Details of the modeling of a 6 MV
                  photon beam delivered by an Elekta Precise Linac,
                  with radiation fields ranging from 5 × 5 to 30 × 30
                  cm(2) at the isocenter are presented. Comparisons
                  were performed with measurements in water. The
                  simulations were performed in two stages: first, the
                  patient-independent part was simulated and a phase
                  space (PhS) was built above the secondary
                  collimator. Then, a multiple source model (MSM)
                  derived from the PhS was proposed to simulate the
                  photon fluence interacting with the
                  patient-dependent part. The selective bremsstrahlung
                  splitting (SBS) variance reduction technique
                  proposed in GATE was used in order to speed up the
                  accelerator head simulation. Further investigations
                  showed that the SBS can be safely used without
                  biasing the simulations. Additional comparisons with
                  full simulations performed on the EGEE grid, in a
                  single stage from the electron source to the water
                  phantom, allowed the evaluation of the MSM. The
                  proposed MSM allowed for calculating depth dose and
                  transverse profiles in 48 hours on a single 2.8 GHz
                  CPU, with a statistical uncertainty of 0.8\% for a
                  10 × 10 cm(2) radiation field, using voxels of 5 × 5
                  × 5 mm(3). Good agreement between simulations and
                  measurements in water was observed, with dose
                  differences of about 1\% and 2\% for depth doses and
                  dose profiles, respectively. Additional gamma index
                  comparisons were performed; more than 90\% of the
                  points for all simulations passed the 3\%/3 mm gamma
                  criterion. To our knowledge, this feasibility study
                  is the first one illustrating the potential of GATE
                  for external radiotherapy applications.},
