\section{Introduction}
Monte Carlo simulations are essential for many medical applications, especially for imaging and radiotherapy. Numerical approaches for imaging applications are used to design new devices, to optimize and study the effect of acquisition parameters on the image quality. They are also extremely useful to validate and assess compensation methods and image reconstruction techniques. For radiotherapy applications, Monte Carlo simulations are used to develop planning treatments so as to optimize the dose distribution in tumour and organs at risk. In this research context, the GATE~\cite{Jan2004,Jan2011} simulation platform has been developed and used since 2002 by the OpenGATE collaboration for which the CEA/SHFJ is the technical coordinator.
The work presented here is based on the relation between cancer therapy by ionizing radiation and imaging devices to characterize the quality of treatment. Actually, the GATE Monte Carlo simulation platform is one of the most usefull numerical tool to study this kind of research activities. In the field of hadrontherapy combined with imaging devices for therapy control and specially Positron Emission Tomography (PET), we propose to use GATE to study the relationship between the image quality and the deposited dose quantification. In this scope, a complete and realistic simulation set-up is define. This numerical scenario includes a validated model of a realistic $^{12}$C pencil beam scanning, a numerical patient based on a thoracic CT scan and a PET camera model for the image acquisition system. This study aims to provide a proof of concept about GATE using to produce hyper-realistic simulations to estimate the PET efficiency for therapeutic control in the case of hadrontherapy treatment, to optimize the design of dedicated PET detectors and to identify the best protocols to control and follow the deposited dose. First results of GATE simulations including a carbon ions ($^{12}$C) irradiation of a lung tumour followed by a full PET acquisition are presented. These simulations were performed on a supercomputer (Computing Center for Research and Technology) using around 1000 CPUs to demonstrate the very high scalability of the GATE Monte Carlo platform.

\subsection{Two steps approach}

For this study, the strategy which is chosen splits the simulation in two parts. The first is focused from the $^{12}$C production to the patient interactions where variables (energy, dose, position) are stored for primary and secondary particles and specially $\beta^+$ emitters distributions which are created by $^{12}$C interactions. At this level, we have a phase space approach and the spatial distributions of $\beta^+$ emitters are stored. These 3D maps are used as an input files for the PET scan acquisition which is the second part of the simulation. This approach where we separate the dose map production and the $\beta^+$ emitters distributions with the PET scanner acquisition, was design to give users opportunities to test different configurations for the imaging system with the same dose deposited data set. With this strategy, it will be also possible to model a pure in-beam PET acquisition if information regarding the gamma prompts produced by $^{12}$C nuclear reactions during tissue interactions, are stored in dedicated files. This gamma prompts file should be also used as a phase space for imaging modelling.\\
Finally, this approach is not a penalty regarding the total computing time of the simulation.     

%When created, such emitters were stopped during the simulation and 

\subsection{Simulation setup: target and beam delivery}

\subsubsection{CT Target}

The geometry of the simulation setup is as follows. Target was imported from a X-Ray Computed Tomograph (CT) image subsampled to $2^3$ mm$^3$ voxel size (1.7 million voxels). Image was described with the method proposed in~\cite{Sarrut2008} allowing fast particle navigation through the matrix of voxels. Hounsfield units where converted into Geant4 materials thanks to the stoichiometric calibration method proposed in~\cite{Schneider2000a}. A density tolerance of $0.1 g/cm^3$ was used leading to $30$ different Geant4 materials, with atomic composition interpolated from 7 initial materials (Air, Lung, Adipose Tissue, Adrenal Gland, Soft Tissues, Connective Tissue, Marrow Bone) according to the mass density. The numerical phantom used for this study is a real patient image of a 4D CT thoracic acquisition including a lung tumour on which an approximated gross tumour volume (GTV) was manually delineated.

\label{fig00}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Physics list}

As recommended by the Geant4 Electromagnetic Standard working group~\cite{G4EMGroup2010} for medical physics applications, we used the electromagnetic (EM) standard package with the option 3 (Opt3) parameters-list. Regarding hadronic interactions, we followed the recommendation of~\cite{Pshenichnov2007, Zacharatou2008}. One difference was, following~\cite{Polf2009, Peterson2009, Grevillot2010}, that we used only the precompound model as inelastic hadronic model even above 80 MeV (unlike~\cite{Pshenichnov2007}), that have been found to be more close to measurement in proton experiments. Very recently, Bohlen et al~\cite{Bohlen2010} proposed a very interesting study comparing nuclear fragmentation models of FLUKA and Geant4 for carbon ion therapy, and gave indication to better tune Geant4. Those recommendation will be included in future works. 
In the case of this study, we are focused on the positron emitter production ($^{11}$C and $^{15}$O) for dosimetry monitoring by PET imaging. As it was demonstrated by Pshenichnov et al.~\cite{Pshenichnov2006} and illustrates by the table \ref{tab:CrossSection}, the numerical model overestimates the cross section production for $^{11}$C and $^{15}$O of 15\% to 20 \%. This will be directly correlated to the PET signal with an overestimation in the same range.

\subsubsection{Scanned beam delivery system}

We considered a virtual beam delivery system inspired from the one described in~\cite{Kramer2000a}. Scanning is achieved with superimposition of multiple carbon ion spots varying in lateral and longitudinal directions, and in energy. The scanning is intended to spread out the dose such that the target volume receive an uniform and high dose.  Given a beam direction, the distal plane of the target volume was sampled with spots positions every 1.5 mm. Each spot was mono-energetic, have a symmetric Gaussian profile of 5 mm FWHM and was directed towards its end point in the distal plane. We considered energy layers every 2 mm (about 3 MeV). We defined a simple pencil
beam model following~\cite{Grevillot2010}. We considered a unique spot size, even if generally, the size depends on the beam energy. More advanced descriptions of a pencil beam scanning delivery technique can be performed~\cite{Grevillot2010} when focus on a real facility. In Carbon facilities, such as at HIT or GSI, the irradiation delivered by the synchrotron is pulsed, with spills (beam extraction) during few seconds (max 2 s) and spill period of about 5s, required for beam injection and acceleration. We considered here a continuous time structure and did not split it into spills. We did not also consider the time required to switch energy between two iso-energy slices, which is typically in the range of 1-2 s~\cite{Rietzel2010}. The optimization of each spot intensity was performed according to the simplified one-dimensional method of~\cite{Kramer2000a} in order to obtain uniform dose in the target part. Optimization was performed field by field. We used a precomputed database of depth deposited energy profiles in water. The database contained profiles with energy from 50 MeV/u to 490 MeV/u, with a 0.05 mm depth resolution and was computed with multiple GATE simulations and stored in a database. Water Equivalent Path Length (WEPL) were computed for all lines going from the virtual beam source to each spot positions in the distal plane and intersecting the CT voxels. Total WEPL was estimated by summing the individual WEPL along all intersected voxels weighted by the intersection length. WEPL for a given material was computed with an approximation of the relative stopping power (to water) computed with the Bethe-Bloch formula: $wepl = \rho \frac{Z/A}{0.555}$, with Z and A the atomic and mass number of the material.\\
In the case of this study, we considered 3 fields leading to almost 6000 individual spots. It does not correspond to real treatment plans but aims at describing representative test case. Three set-up of primary carbon ions flux were launched. Typical irradiation-dose rate is 5 GyE/min/l~\cite{Noda2007}, corresponding to an intensity of $1.2\times 10^9$ pps (particles per seconds). Regarding our simplified pencil beam description, we thus considered that in a range of $10^8$ to $10^9$ particles reach the patient will correspond to 1 Gy to 10 Gy at the tumour. Table \ref{tab:setup} shows the beam set-up for the 3 configurations.

\subsubsection{Scorers}

Dose was scored with the GateDoseActor described in~\cite{Jan2010,Sarrut2008} which store deposit dose and energy distribution in a 3D matrix of dosels, together with the associated statistical uncertainty. We choose a matrix of dosels of size $2\times 2 \times 2 mm^3$. 
We also stored the 3D distribution of point of creation of $\beta^+$ emitters during the irradiation. We limited emitters scoring to the two main ones, $^{11}C$ and $^{15}O$~\cite{Pshenichnov2007}, the others ($^{10}C$, $^{13}N$, $^{14}O$, $^{17,18}F$, $^{30}P$, for those with more than 10 s of half-live) were considering to have negligible influence on a reconstructed PET image but could also be stored if needed.\\

\subsection{Simulation set-up: PET scan for dose monitoring}

The PET acquisition modelling is the second part of the complete simulation set-up. It's not an in-beam PET configuration which explain that there is no contamination by the gamma prompts emission during the acquisition.

\subsubsection{Scanner description}

The scanner modelled for this study is the commerdial ECAT EXACT HR+~\cite{Brix1997} system by Siemens. This  scanner  is made of four rings of BGO blocks partially cut into an 8x8 array of crystals measuring 4.0x4.1x30 mm$^3$ each, resulting in a 82.7 cm diameter detector cylinder and an  axial field-of-view (F.O.V.) length of 15.5 cm. Figure~\ref{fig:fig0} shows the global geometry description of the HR+ scanner with GATE in the 3D acquisition mode where we defined the BGO blocks, a back compartment to simulate the back scattering induced by the light collection system, the lead end-shielding, and the patient bed. The simulation assumes an energy resolution for each crystal randomly drawn from a uniform distribution varying between $20 \%$ and $30 \%$ at 511 keV. The determination of the hit crystal is based on the crystal with the highest energy deposition, to which an additional analytical spatial blurring based on a 2D Gauss kernel can be applied to model the decrease induced by the photomultiplier tube Anger electronic system. A global sensitivity factor is also defined for each block to replicate the sensitivity performance of the scanner; this efficiency factor is set at $90 \%$ in the case of the HR+. As for the experimental data, a 350-650 keV energy window and a 12 ns coincidence time window were applied. This PET scanner was already modelled and validated by using GATE and all results are described in~\cite{Jan2005}.

\caption{Illustration of the PET scanner simulated with GATE and one of the 288 bloc PET detectors which is composed by 64 BGO crystals for the Siemens HR+
scanner}
\label{fig:fig0}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Data treatments and image reconstruction}

To improve the data quantification, the simulated data are normalized, attenuated corrected and reconstructed using the 3D OSEM method~\cite{OSEM ref}. To speed-up the complete processing, we used a PET analytic simulator, ASIM~\cite{Comtat1999}, with the ECAT HR+ scanner geometry description to produce the normalization sinogram. For the attenuation correction, coefficient factors (ACFs) are also calculated with ASIM using the voxelized attenuation map description provided by the numerical patient phantom. 

\subsection{Running GATE on a High Performance Computing machine}

These simulations were running at the French Rechearch and Technology Computing Center~\cite{CCRT} on the TITANE supercomputer. This is a cluster integrating 1596 Bull NovaScale R422 servers, with 2 Intel Xeon 5570 quad core processors each including a memory of 3 Go per core. With 3192 Intel Xeon 5570 4 cores, TITANE offers a processing capacity in excess of 90 teraflops, and 25 terabytes of core memory, which put it in june 2009 in 38th place of the worldwide supercomputer sites Top500 ranking. The TITANE cluster operates the Bull HPC software platform that includes the Linux operating system and the global and parallel Lustre file system. This platform is based on an open source software integrated and optimized by Bull's HPC competence center in Echirolles, France.

The figure~\ref{fig:fig1} shows the dose deposited during irradiation and the $\beta^+$ emitter maps for $^{11}$C and $^{15}$O isotopes which are produced by $^{12}$C interactions for the protocol S3 where 10 Gy were deposited on the tumour. These images are the qualitative proof of concept of the GATE capabilities to perform complete and realistic simulations in the field of hadrontherapy coupled with a nuclear imaging device.

\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

To validate the interest to model the complete scheme from the radiation to the scanner acquisition system, we have compared the final image with and without a dedicated model of the PET camera. The figure~\ref{fig:fig2} shows what we can find in the literature: the PET scanner is modelled by using a smoothing spatial Gaussian function applied on the $\beta^{+}$ emitters distribution maps. This approach does not take into account some important physical effects like positron range in tissue, material attenuation, photon scattering and the sensitivity of the PET camera including the detection solid angle and the intrinsic detector response. All these effects have an impact on the image quality and finally on the dose quantification with a PET acquisition. The difference is clearly demonstrated when we compare the images on figure~\ref{fig:fig2} and what we obtained with the protocol $S_{3}$ illustrated by the figure~\ref{fig:fig3} where the PET camera is modelled. Without PET camera modelling, the quality and image contrast with a dose delivery of 1 Gy in the target is higher than what we can obtained with 10 Gy in the same protocol which includes the PET camera model. This result demonstrates that data quantification is not realistic with a simplified approach of the imaging system.

\end{figure}
An other point that we can discussed, is relative to the  $^{15}$O isotope contribution in the PET images of $^{11}$C distribution. Or with other words, is it necessary to develop a dedicated method to correct the $^{11}$C PET image from the $^{15}$O contribution ? As precised in the table~\ref{tab:CrossSection} the $^{11}$C production is higher than $^{15}$O by a factor 4 or 5 between with the $^{12}$C beam characteristics on this set-up. The isotope half-life is also an important parameter to estimate the $^{15}$O contribution on the PET image analysis: 2 minutes for $^{15}$O against 20 minutes for $^{11}$C. If we take into account these 2 effects, with a PET acquisition of 10 minutes (post-irradiation), there is a factor 70 in the production rate between the 2 isotopes. This is illustrated by the figure~\ref{fig:fig5} where it is clear that the quantitative analysis of the location and the dose deposited on the target will not be constrained by the presence of multi $\beta^+$ emitters and specially by the $^{15}$O.

\label{fig:fig5}
\end{figure} 

The profiles illustrated by the figure~\ref{fig:fig4} allow us to assess the potential for quantification of PET imaging in function of the dose deposited in the tumour. These profiles are made on the most active distribution area of the $\beta^+$ isotopes: the tumour for the $^{11}$C and thoracic tissue for $^{15}$O. It is clear that the dose of 1 Gy in the target seems to define the minimal dose for PET imaging quantification on this kind of protocol. Table~\ref{tab:results} summarizes the main protocol parameters to illustrate whether a therapeutic control with PET imaging is feasible.

\section{Conclusion}

This study demonstrates the capability to perform with GATE some very realistic simulations in the field of hadrontherapy and nuclear imaging for dose monitoring. Thanks to high scalability of the code, this work shows also that the GATE platform is clearly a tool to produce huge Monte Carlo data volume if using a computing center. This characteristic should be an advantage for data base production which could be clearly interesting to work on protocol optimization and to define and validate analytical models for dose monitoring. We demonstrate in this study that to perform a PET imaging monitoring, the deposited dose should be higher than 1 Gy for a target volume close to 4 ml. In this way of quantification and regarding the contribution of multi $\beta^+$ emitters for a post-irradiation PET acquisition more longer that 10 minutes, we conclude that it is not necessary to develop some isotope deconvolution methods to quantified the correlation between $^{11}$C distribution and dose deposited by $^{12}$C.\\
An important point in this study was focused on the impact of realistic PET scanner modelling versus using a Gaussian function response as it is usually done. In this way, we demonstrate clearly that GATE simulation tool is adapted to design imaging systems for hadrontherapy and specially in the way of PET detection and gamma prompts detection, to optimize the sensitivity and the quantitative performances to monitor the patient beam delivery and dose applied on the target volume. In this perspective, it is well known that a major challenge concern the detection with a very low statistic of events where the performances of the imaging system and the image reconstruction algorithm are crutials. Some approaches are focused on the 4D algorithm developments~\cite{bib:Fall2011} and clearly it will be essential to validate all these new approaches to produce very realistic data sets of irradiation protocols associated to the imaging system for therapeutic control.
