This example represents the simulation of a carbon ion / proton 
irradiation covering an artificial target inside a CT patient image. 


------------
To start this example : Users need to run the "radiotherapy.mac" file
------------

Data
----

All the input data are in 'data' folder, it contains : 
- the image used in the simulation : patient1-2mm.hdr/img
- material definition : patient1-HUmaterials.db
- link between image labels and material : patient1-HU2mat.txt
- These macros read the two
  files Schneider2000MaterialsTable.txt and
  Schneider2000DensitiesTable.txt

Conversion from Hounsfield units to Geant4 materials
----------------------------------------------------

Method : see [schneider2000]. 
Start with two Hounsfield (H) tables : 
one relating H to material composition, one relating H to
mass densities. Resulting G4 materials are built by associating with
each H range in the first material table a mean density interpolated
in the second table. A parameter 'DensityTolerance' allow to
automatically split the H range composition into several material
having the same composition but different densities.

Warning : there is no CT calibration here. It is the user
responsability to convert is own Hounsfields unit with a calibration
curve.

This example represents the simulation of a proton source in a beam line,
using the PencilBeamScanning source.
This source allows for representing the optical and energetical properties of the source.

------------
Outputs:
- 4 phase spaces files (.root)
- 1 depth-dose profile in water (.txt)
> Additional root macro file is proposed to visualize the beam emmitances, spot size and energy spectrum
from the ".root" files.
------------

------------
To start this example: Users need to run the "mainMacro.mac" file
------------

------------
To visualize the output using root: Users need to run the "PhS-Analysis.C" file

This example represents the simulation of a proton source based on a pencil beam scanning treatment plan
using the TPSPencilBeamScanning source.
This source allows for simulating a stack of single pencil beams.

------------
Data
- artificial source model (Source-Properties.txt)
- treatment plan (PlanDescriptionToGATE.txt)

------------
Outputs:
- 1 phase space file (.root)
> Additional root macro file is proposed to visualize the scored output
from the ".root" files.

1)This example presents the calculation of water equivalent dose distributions so called "dose to water".
Calculating "dose to water" in addition to the default "dose to medium" is usefull, when comparing dose distributions exported from calculation tools based on water equivalent path length approximations, such as a Treatment Planning System (TPS).

2)This example also shows how to use the "EmCalculatorActor" tool, which allow extracting electromagnetic (EM) properties for all materials defined in a simulation.
In this example, material properties are calculated for a 150 MeV proton.

------------
Data
- physics-list.mac and parameters-list.mac (from "Grevillot2010, NIM-B")
- GateMaterials.db, with a new material named G4_WATER

------------

------------
Outputs:
- 2 dose files: 
    - IDD-Dose.txt (i.e. default dose to tissue)
    - IDD-DoseToWater.txt (i.e. dose to water)
- 1 "EmCalculatorActor" output:
    - "EM-properties.txt"
------------

------------
dataProcessing
- display of the two doses using the gnumeric software in "GateExampleDoseToWater.gnumeric"
- a pdf version of the curves is also proposed (GateExampleDoseToWater.pdf)
