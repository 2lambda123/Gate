# GATE can not decide which sampling plane you want to use, as it depends
# on the orientation you have chosen when you built the head
# Thus, you must specify the projection plane ('XY', 'YZ' or 'ZX').
# In our case, the head was built orthogonally to the X-axis, so put logical sampling plane is 'YZ'

# You can select the level of verbosity of the module
# At level 1, it tells about incorrect (out-of-bounds) counts (digis)
# At level 2, it tells where it stores each count (digis)
# For this example, I pick level 1, so that you can see if you lose some counts
